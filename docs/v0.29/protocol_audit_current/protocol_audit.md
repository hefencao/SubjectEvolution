# Structural measurement protocol audit

Schema: `structural-measurement-protocol-audit-v1`
Audit SHA-256: `47c56e44a6aeb91a20752999c2dd2a349c6d888a8548cb585fcb3bb75e0ffc53`

## Group label

- schema: `trusted-directed-fixed-round-min-label-v1`
- threshold / rounds / minimum members: 0.12 / 8 / 6
- refresh mode: `adaptive-topology-v1`
- propagation: initialize label as physical slot index; for each fixed round, replace an entity label by the minimum of its current label and labels reachable through eligible outgoing relation slots
- token: stable entity ID at the propagated minimum root slot; components below minimum members receive token 0 and remain ungrouped
- boundary: finite-round directed minimum-label propagation is an approximate candidate-group measurement, not a subject-existence verdict

## Spatial regions

- schema: `normalized-fixed-count-grid-v1`
- grid: 4 × 4 (16 regions)
- physical region: 32.0 × 32.0
- world cells per region: 8.0 × 8.0
- grid-aligned: True
- map-size semantics: fixed region counts over normalized coordinates; physical area and represented world-cell count scale with map dimensions and resolution
